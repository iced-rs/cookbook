# Clipboard copying

Illustrate a button that converts an SVG to a PNG and copies that to the clipboard.

As implemented, the clipboard copying only works on a Mac.

This includes code copied with small changes from the resvg and pasteboard crates.

Run with `cargo run --release --package copy_image_to_clipboard`.
