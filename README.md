## Purpose
The examples in the main Iced repository are to show core functionality, like how to use a [`Picklist`](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/tree/master/examples/pick_list) or very common proof of concept examples like [`TodoMVC`](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/tree/master/examples/todos). Though clearly there is more that can be accomplished in a GUI framework than a few dozen examples. That is where this cookbook come in!

## Who can contribute?
Basically anyone that can write rust code that uses the Iced framework. This cookbook can be used as a place to show anything from a cool trick you made in your project to an educational tool to help other developers!
If you see an example that could be improved PRs for that are very welcome! Typo and translation PRs are too!

## How does it work?
This repository is split into folders named to correspond with versions of Iced. Please pick the folder that coresponds to the version of Iced the example uses and create a folder with a reasonable name for the project. 

There are a few requirements to contribute,
+ The example must run completely with the command `cargo run`.
+ Please include a README.md that clearly explains the purpose of the example and how it works. As well as an image/gif showing the example in action!
+ If your example is OS specific please state that in your README. 
+ Be nice.

## Future goals
For now this repository is just to organize code from the awesome Iced community. In the future all examples will be searchable from the [iced.rs](https://iced.rs) website, and examples here may be used in the offical guide!



> This repository also follows the same [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) as the Iced parent repository.
